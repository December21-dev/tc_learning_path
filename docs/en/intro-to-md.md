# Getting Started with Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you format plain text using simple syntax. Files using Markdown have the `.md` extension and can be easily converted to HTML or other formats. Its human-readable format makes it perfect for documentation that needs to be both machine-processable and author-friendly.

## Why Markdown for Docs-as-Code?

When practicing **docs-as-code**, Markdown shines because:

- **Collaboration Ready**: Easy to read/write for both technical and non-technical contributors
- **Toolchain Integration**: Supported by all major platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and static site generators
- **Low Barrier**: Quick to learn compared to complex formatting tools

## Essential Markdown Syntax

Here are fundamental formatting patterns:

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

**Bold Text** or __Bold__
*Italic Text* or _Italic_

- Unordered List
- With hyphens

1. Ordered List
2. With numbers
