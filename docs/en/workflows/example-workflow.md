# Real projects

Then I'll introduce some real project that you can try to contribution to.

## PingCap/TiDB - docs

There are two documentation projects for TiDB under the PingCAP organization: [English](https://github.com/pingcap/docs) and [Chinese](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn) documents. For these two documentation projects, there are several ways we can contribute. We can translate documents from Chinese to English or vice versa. Additionally, we can identify and correct any writing mistakes found within the documents, like operation steps that are incorrectly described. Remember to edit based on its [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## FOSScope

For the FOSScope TranslateProject found on GitHub, this initiative focuses on the E-C translation of oversea articles in categories like talk, news, tech and so on. We can contribute to this project by selecting the awaiting articles in `source` folder and then editing by following the [Contribution Guidelines](https://fosscope.com/wiki/fosscope-workflow/translation-workflow). This following picture is the official website of this project on which you can read some translated articles.
