# Introduction of the guide

In this guide, there will be the following four parts discussed to introduce the docs-like-code workflow:

1. Git and GitHub
2. Markdown format
3. Open-source frames like Mkdocs

Before we start the detailed learning of docs-like-code workflow, let's take few minutes to understand it from a general perspective.

Most of the content in this guide is from the book [Docs-Like-Code](.com). I just make a simple summary of this book combined with my own experiences with this workflow.

## Why treat docs like code?

Here the code means code in Github that will be introduced in the next part. What your need to know now is that code here means writing code in a version control system and by a collaborative way.

This workflow leans heavily on Git and GitHub.

Writing and managing documents like code ensures better collaboration, version control, and automation.
