# Introduction of the guide

Before we start the detailed learning of docs-like-code workflow, let's take few minutes to understand it from a general perspective.

>Most of the content in this guide is from the book Docs-Like-Code. I just make a simple summary of this book combined with my own experiences with this workflow.

## Why treat docs like code?

Treating docs like code means that make writing documents and writing codes the same way.

Then, what does the way that code goes?

Mostly, programmer write and manage code in the following process and tools:

1. Edit code in [an IDE(Integrated Development Environment)](preparation.md#download-visual-studio-code) like Visual Studio Code.
2. Store and review code with code hosting platform like GitHub
3. Collaborate and manage different versions with Git Branches.
4. Tracking issues in Github
5. Publish automatically with CI/CD systems like Github Actions.

Then, docs-like-code approach encourage us to write documents in the same process and related tools. You can see that this workflow leans heavily on [Git and GitHub](preparation.md#download-github-desktop), which will be introduced in detail.

For more detailed purposes and introduction, you can read the book Docs-Like-Code. This guide is mainly focused on practices.

## Structure of the guide

In this guide, there will be the following four parts discussed to introduce the docs-like-code workflow:

1. **Git and GitHub**: introduction the Git and GitHub and the usage of GitHub Desktop;
2. **Markdown**: a brief introduction to Markdown and its writing grammar;
3. **Projects**: some GitHub projects help you master the workflow and a simple practice of  doc-like-code workflow;
4. **Open-Source Frames(待确认)**: some resources including technical writing courses, open source tools for generating docs.
