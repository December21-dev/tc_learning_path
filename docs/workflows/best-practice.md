# Hands-on examples

## A demo project

Now you can take your first step on your path to Technical Writing. It's just like a "Hello World" in Docs-like-code. We will take a demo project to experience the whole-process docs-like-code contribution, which is mostly like [the workflow of git](/docs/git-and-github/git-functions.md/#2-the-workflow-of-git) with some extra steps.

1. Find the the specific document of Contribution Guildance.
2. Save and version control in Git.
3. Push to GitHub.
4. Build the site with MkDocs.
