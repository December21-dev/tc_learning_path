# Welcome to Path to a TCer

Thanks for your interest in the docs-like-code approach. This guide is designed to introduce you to this workflow within the realm of technical writing. It aims to help writers manage documentation as they would code, collaborate efficiently, and produce professional, accessible documents using tools such as Git, GitHub, Markdown, and open-source frames like MkDocs.

## Why Write This Guide?

I have always wanted to create this guide on docs-like-code for three main reasons:

1. To connect with like-minded individuals who want to develop projects together.
2. To explore additional career opportunities for English learners.
3. To contribute to the Open Source Community.

## Who Is This Guide For?

This guide is intended for those who are **students on the path of learning technical writing or TCer but new to either docs-like-code approach**.

For the former, I hope this guide sparks your interest in the docs-like-code methodology, fostering further communication and mutual learning. For the latter, I hope this guide can bring you new ideas on your own workflow.
